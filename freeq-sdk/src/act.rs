//! Signing and verification for `freeq.at/act` action messages.
//!
//! Implements the act canonical from the act RFC — the gist body plus the
//! comment thread, which is part of the RFC. The signature covers **every
//! `act-*` tag present** on the message — not a fixed field list —
//! JCS-canonicalized (RFC 8785) with sorted keys. Adding or stripping an
//! `act-*` tag in transit changes the rebuilt canonical, so tampering is
//! detected by construction.
//!
//! ## Canonical keys are semantic names (thread agreement, 2026-08-02)
//!
//! The document's key for a field is the field's semantic name; the wire tag
//! name is framing. Three keys are **mandatory** in every act document:
//!
//! - **`from`** — the signer's DID, riding the wire in `+freeq.at/from`: an
//!   envelope tag like `eventid`, not an `act-*` tag, read explicitly rather
//!   than swept.
//! - **`id`** — the event id the signer minted, riding the wire in
//!   [`crate::chatsig::EVENT_ID_TAG`]. A task's id is its identity for the
//!   rest of its life, so it cannot be the one unsigned thing about it.
//! - **`target`** — the normalized venue ([`crate::chatsig::channel_venue`] /
//!   [`crate::chatsig::dm_venue`]), supplied by the signer and rebuilt by the
//!   verifier from delivery context. The channel is the queue: without it, an
//!   offer signed in one room replays into another with its signature intact.
//!
//! A document missing a mandatory field reads **unverifiable, never
//! invalid** — `from`/`id`/`target` are not `act-`prefixed, so sign-every-
//! `act-*` alone cannot strip-detect them, and an absence is not evidence
//! about the sender ([`ActSigError::MissingFrom`]; `id` and `target` are
//! caller-supplied here, so their absence is the caller's to report).
//!
//! (Until 2026-08 this module signed the pre-agreement keys `act-from` and
//! `msgid`. That never matched what the thread froze on 2026-08-02; the
//! realignment replaced the keys and regenerated the vector file. No history
//! survives under the old keys — pre-realignment act events were discarded.)
//!
//! ## Only the sender writes `act-` tags
//!
//! The open coverage rule is what lets a new task kind add fields without
//! anyone updating a canonical — and it only works under one discipline: an
//! `act-` tag is written by the sender and by nobody else. A server that
//! stamped a tag of its own under that prefix would land it inside the
//! signature's coverage and break every act signature it relayed. Server
//! attestations go in their own namespaces (`account`, `time`, `msgid`,
//! `+freeq.at/origin`), exactly as they do for chat.
//!
//! Canonical mapping rules (frozen by the fixtures in
//! `spec/act-signing-vectors.json`, which the TS implementations must
//! reproduce byte-for-byte):
//!
//! - A tag is covered iff its name, after stripping the `+freeq.at/`
//!   client-tag prefix, is `act` or starts with `act-`. (`actor-class` does
//!   NOT match; `sig` does not match.) The unprefixed forms are accepted too.
//! - Canonical keys are the **stripped** tag names. The vendor
//!   prefix never reaches a document, so a future de-vendoring of the tag
//!   names changes no signature — with one honest caveat: the coverage
//!   predicate below recognizes the current wire spellings, so a renamed
//!   wire tag also needs its spelling added there (a code change, not a
//!   canonical change).
//! - Values are the (IRC-unescaped) tag values, verbatim, always JSON
//!   strings — `act-deadline` is not coerced to a number.
//! - `id` and `target` are injected by the caller, never read from a tag.
//!   No injected name can collide with a covered tag: every covered key
//!   starts with `act`.
//! - An offer carries no `act-id` — its own event id *is* the task's id. The
//!   later events in a task's life name that id in `act-id` and mint their
//!   own id for themselves.
//! - The canonical bytes are the UTF-8 of `canonical::canonicalize` over
//!   that string→string map.
//!
//! The sig tag value is `ed25519:<kid>:<base64url sig>` — the format shared
//! by every freeq signing profile, which lives in [`crate::sigtag`] (kid
//! derivation, parsing, the raw sign/verify over canonical bytes) so the act
//! and chat profiles cannot disagree about it.
