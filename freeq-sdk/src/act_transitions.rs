//! The task lifecycle: which move is legal, from which state, and by whom.
//!
//! The rules live in `spec/act-transitions.json`, not in this file. A kind
//! names the verb that **creates** one of its tasks and the state that lands
//! in, its terminal states, and a row per legal move on a task that already
//! exists — verb, the states it may be made from, the state it lands in, and
//! the role the sender must hold. Adding a task kind is an edit to that file; this
//! module is the code that reads it, and stays the same size as kinds are
//! added. That is the whole point of the arrangement: an event whose kind the
//! file does not list is refused, so a server's enforced rules are never wider
//! than the rules somebody wrote down.
//!
//! The TypeScript package carries a byte-identical copy of the file and a
//! mirror of this checker, so a bot can pre-check a move before sending it and
//! reach the same verdict the server will.
//!
//! What is *not* here: whether the signature checked out, whether the sender
//! is a channel operator, and whether anyone's declared capabilities suit the
//! work — that last one by ruling, not omission: `act-caps` is a hint to store
//! and filter on, never a gate. This module answers one question, about one
//! event, given what the caller already knows.
