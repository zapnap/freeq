//! IRC client with ATPROTO-CHALLENGE SASL support.
//!
//! This is the main entry point for SDK consumers. It manages the TCP
//! connection, IRC registration, CAP/SASL negotiation, and emits events.
//! Supports both plaintext and TLS connections.
//!
//! ## SASL Authentication
//!
//! Two SASL methods are supported:
//!
//! - **`web-token`**: A short-lived token minted by the auth broker after OAuth.
//!   Set `config.sasl_token` and `config.sasl_method = "web-token"`. The token is
//!   sent as the SASL payload and verified against the server's in-memory token map.
//!   Tokens expire after 5 minutes. Best for web and mobile clients that go through
//!   the OAuth broker flow.
//!
//! - **`crypto`**: Direct cryptographic challenge-response using the user's AT Protocol
//!   signing key. Set `config.sasl_method = "crypto"` and provide a DID + signing key.
//!   The server sends a challenge; the client signs it; the server verifies against the
//!   DID document. Best for bots and CLI tools with direct key access.
//!
//! ## Reconnection
//!
//! The SDK does not implement automatic reconnection. Consumers should implement
//! their own reconnect logic with exponential backoff (e.g., 2→4→8→16→30s cap)
//! to avoid overwhelming the server. Listen for [`Event::Disconnected`] and retry.
