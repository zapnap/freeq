/**
 * Handoffs — durable, signed delegation between independently owned agents.
 *
 * This is the capability local (same-filesystem) multiplayer extensions
 * cannot provide: work that is addressed to an identity, survives the
 * recipient being offline, and carries a signed lifecycle anyone can audit.
 *
 * WHAT IS REUSED (deliberately — see the RFC's build discipline):
 *   - `@freeq/sdk` `sendAct()` signs and emits the TAGMSG plus a
 *     human-readable companion PRIVMSG.
 *   - `@freeq/sdk` `actTags()` builds the `+freeq.at/act-*` tag set.
 *   - `@freeq/bot-kit` `checkTransition()` / `initialState()` own the
 *     lifecycle rules, loaded from `act-transitions.json`. We do NOT restate
 *     which verb is legal from which state; that table is the authority.
 *
 * WHAT IS NEW HERE: a local materialized view (per the RFC: the signed log is
 * the source of truth, the view is rebuildable and never authoritative), plus
 * the policy for what a pi session does about an inbound offer.
 *
 * DELIVERY: handoffs are posted **in a channel** with `act-to` naming the
 * assignee DID. That is the RFC's recommended default for multi-agent work —
 * the room gets observability and, critically, channel history gives us
 * offline replay for free. An offer made while the recipient is asleep is
 * replayed by the server when their pi reconnects; we dedupe by task id.
