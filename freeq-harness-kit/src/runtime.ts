/**
 * The freeq side of an agent harness: one agent's session on freeq.
 *
 * Hard rules (carried over from freeq-pi, where this code began):
 *   - remote input never invokes local tools directly: it becomes a framed,
 *     tier-gated message, and the local agent decides what to do
 *   - content reaches the model in exactly ONE place (`deliver`), gated by
 *     `decideInbound` — no other code path may inject remote input
 *   - no filesystem paths in advertised presence
 *   - connection failure degrades to offline, never breaks the session
 *
 * The harness (`harness.ts`) supplies delivery into the model, notices and
 * confirmations, the journal, and what the session is doing. The harness
 * calls the `on…` methods here from its own events.
