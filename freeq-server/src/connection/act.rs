//! Task messages: recognizing them, and refusing the ones that are not right.
//!
//! A message carrying `act-` tags is a task event. It is accepted only from a
//! logged-in sender whose signature checks out over the document the signer
//! built — the act tags, the venue, and the id it minted — and only for a kind
//! and a verb `spec/act-transitions.json` lists. Every other outcome is a
//! refusal that names its cause.
//!
//! Nothing here stores anything. An accepted task message is delivered to the
//! connections that asked for `freeq.at/act` and relayed to peers with its tag
//! map intact; where it goes on disk is a later concern.
//!
//! Only the sender ever writes `act-` tags. The signature covers every one of
//! them, so a tag this server added under that prefix would land inside the
//! coverage and break the signature it was checking. Nothing in this module
//! writes one.
