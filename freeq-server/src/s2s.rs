//! Server-to-server (S2S) clustering via iroh.
//!
//! Servers connect to each other using iroh's QUIC transport, forming
//! a mesh network. State is propagated via a simple message protocol
//! on bidirectional streams.
//!
//! # Design (post-audit)
//!
//! - **Peer identity**: iroh endpoint ID is the root identity everywhere.
//!   `server_name` is untrusted display metadata included for logging.
//! - **Event dedup**: every S2S event carries an `event_id` (origin + counter).
//!   A bounded LRU per peer prevents duplicate application on reconnect.
//! - **Source of truth**: presence is S2S-event-only (not CRDT). Topic and
//!   durable authority use CRDT as the convergent source of truth; S2S
//!   events are notifications for immediate UX delivery.
//! - **CRDT sync keyed by iroh endpoint ID** (cryptographic identity).
//!
//! # Protocol
//!
//! Each S2S link uses a single bidirectional QUIC stream carrying
//! newline-delimited JSON messages. Messages are typed:
//!
//! ```json
//! {"type":"hello","peer_id":"44f1415c...","server_name":"freeq"}
//! {"type":"privmsg","event_id":"44f1415c:42","from":"nick!user@host","target":"#channel","text":"hello"}
//! ```
//!
//! # Topology
//!
//! Simple mesh: each server connects to all configured peers. Messages
//! are forwarded with origin tracking to prevent loops.
