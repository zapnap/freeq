//! Verdicts for task events relayed from peer servers, and what follows from
//! each one.
//!
//! Two families of task event cross S2S as a `Tagmsg`: the act family
//! (`act-*` tags, signed under the act canonical — see [`freeq_sdk::act`])
//! and the older stopgap coordination family (`+freeq.at/event`, signed as a
//! chat-profile coordination document — see [`freeq_sdk::chatsig`]). This
//! module is where the receive side reaches its own verdict about each one.
//!
//! The verdict is three-way, the distinction is the RFC's central rule, and
//! each answer leads somewhere different:
//!
//! - **Valid** — the rebuilt document verifies against the signer's key.
//!   Stored, applied as far as the task's origin allows, and delivered.
//! - **Invalid** — the named key was found and the bytes do not verify.
//!   Evidence of tampering or forgery, never a fallback classification, and
//!   the one verdict that stops an event: not delivered, not stored.
//! - **Unverifiable** — everything else: no key on file, no key server
//!   configured for the origin, an algorithm this build does not know, a
//!   mandatory field missing. An outage or an old peer is not evidence about
//!   the sender, so none of these may ever read as invalid and none is ever
//!   refused. Neither stored nor shown while it waits: what this server
//!   cannot check it does not present as a task. It waits in [`DeferQueue`]
//!   for the key that would settle it, and is judged again when one arrives.
//!
//! The verdict itself consults no server state: the caller resolves the DM
//! recipient and supplies the key lookup, which is what makes the checker
//! provable against the committed vectors (`spec/act-signing-vectors.json`,
//! `spec/chat-signing-vectors.json`) without a server around it.
