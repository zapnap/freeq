# Self-Hosting Guide

Run your own freeq server with TLS, the web client, and optional federation.

> Just want it running? The [Self-Hosting Quickstart](self-hosting-quickstart.md)
> covers the three simplest paths (Miren, Docker, single binary) with
> copy-paste commands. This guide is the full reference.

## Recommended: Miren

The default self-hosting path. [Miren](https://miren.md/) is a container
platform you run on your own server. The repo ships a ready Miren config at
[`.miren/app.toml`](../.miren/app.toml) — three commands build and deploy
the IRC server **and** the web client, with HTTPS routing, automatic Let's
Encrypt certs, a persistent managed disk for the database and keys, and a
hard pin to one instance (IRC state is in-process — no autoscaling):

```bash
# Prerequisites: a Miren server + the miren CLI installed and logged in
# (host firewall: TCP 80/443 + UDP 8443 open)
git clone https://github.com/freeq-irc/freeq
cd freeq

miren deploy -e FREEQ_SERVER_NAME=irc.example.com
miren route set irc.example.com freeq
miren env set -s OPER_PASSWORD   # optional, masked prompt
```

Then point DNS at your cluster — a CNAME to its `*.miren.systems` hostname
for subdomains, or ALIAS/ANAME/A at the apex. The web client is served at
the root, WebSocket IRC at `/irc`, REST API at `/api/v1/*`; native TCP IRC
(6667) is a documented opt-in.

The full 10-minute walkthrough — DNS options, secrets, where the SQLite
data lives and how to back it up, upgrades, the auth broker, and federation
flags — is in [deploy/miren/README.md](../deploy/miren/README.md).

## Fallback: Docker Compose

If you don't run Miren, Docker Compose gives you the same stack (server +
web client, with optional nginx TLS termination and OAuth broker):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/freeq-irc/freeq
cd freeq
cp .env.example .env    # edit with your values
docker compose up -d
```

For TLS termination with nginx:
```bash
docker compose --profile with-tls up -d
```

The OAuth broker (AT Protocol web login) is embedded in the server by
default — no extra service needed. To run it as a separate service instead
(separate auth domain, sessions that survive restarts):
```bash
docker compose --profile with-broker up -d
```

Plain Docker, without compose (builds from source — prebuilt
`ghcr.io/freeq-irc/freeq` images arrive with the first tagged release):

```bash
docker build -t freeq .
docker run -d \
  -p 6667:6667 -p 8080:8080 \
  -v freeq-data:/data \
  freeq
```

## From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/freeq-irc/freeq
cd freeq
cargo build --release -p freeq-server

# Start with defaults (port 6667, no TLS, in-memory)
./target/release/freeq-server --bind 0.0.0.0:6667
```

For a bare-VPS install with systemd + nginx + certbot, see
[deploy/README.md](../deploy/README.md) (`./deploy/setup.sh yourdomain.com --nginx`).

## Configuration Reference

### Listeners

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--bind` | `127.0.0.1:6667` | Plain TCP listener |
| `--tls-bind` | `127.0.0.1:6697` | TLS listener (requires cert + key) |
| `--web-addr` | *(none)* | HTTP/WebSocket listener |

### TLS

```bash
freeq-server \
  --bind 0.0.0.0:6667 \
  --tls-bind 0.0.0.0:6697 \
  --tls-cert /path/to/cert.pem \
  --tls-key /path/to/key.pem
```

Use Let's Encrypt with auto-renewal for production. See the nginx config
below for TLS termination at the reverse proxy instead.

### Web Client

```bash
cd freeq-app && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

freeq-server \
  --bind 0.0.0.0:6667 \
  --web-addr 0.0.0.0:8080 \
  --web-static-dir freeq-app/dist
```

The web client is served at the root path. WebSocket IRC is at `/irc`.
REST API endpoints are at `/api/v1/*`.

### Persistence

```bash
freeq-server --db-path /data/irc.db --data-dir /data
```

Or keep everything in a file instead of a flag list. Every flag is also a TOML key under its underscore name; precedence is CLI flag > environment variable > file > default, and an unknown key is a startup error naming the key (typos fail loudly rather than being silently ignored):

```toml
# /etc/freeq/server.toml
listen_addr = "0.0.0.0:6667"
web_addr = "0.0.0.0:8080"
db_path = "/data/irc.db"
data_dir = "/data"
server_name = "irc.example.com"
iroh = true
s2s_allowed_peers = ["44f1415c..."]

# Where each federation peer serves its users' signing keys:
[s2s_peer_api]
"44f1415c..." = "https://irc.example.com"
```

```bash
freeq-server --config /etc/freeq/server.toml
```

`--migrate-to` stays CLI-only on purpose — a config file that migrates-and-exits on every boot would be a footgun. The repo ships a complete commented example as `server.toml.example`, kept in sync with the schema by a test.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--config` | *(none)* | TOML file of options; flags and env vars override it |
| `--check-config` | | Validate configuration and exit — run before a restart to catch bad edits |
| `--db-path` | *(none — in-memory)* | SQLite database file |
| `--migrate-to` | *(none)* | Run the schema ladder to this version and exit (see [Schema migrations](#schema-migrations)) |
| `--data-dir` | parent of `--db-path` | Directory for keys and iroh state |
| `--rotate-signing-key` | off | Replaces the server's message signing key with a new one at startup and marks the old key retired in the server's key store. Use it when the key may have leaked or the host was rebuilt from a copy. It rotates once per start, so remove the flag after that start. |
| `--max-messages-per-channel` | `10000` | Prune oldest messages beyond this count |

### Identity & Auth

| Flag / Env | Description |
|---|---|
| `--server-name` | IRC server name (appears in messages) |
| `--challenge-timeout-secs` | SASL challenge validity window (default: 60) |
| `--oper-password` / `OPER_PASSWORD` | Enable OPER command with this password |
| `--oper-dids` / `OPER_DIDS` | DIDs auto-granted server operator on connect |
| `BROKER_SHARED_SECRET` | HMAC secret shared with auth broker |
| `--auth-broker-url` / `AUTH_BROKER_URL` | Base URL of the standalone auth broker; a device sign-out deletes its session there (read only with `BROKER_SHARED_SECRET`) |
| `--record-cache-secs` / `RECORD_CACHE_SECS` | How long a signer's identity-record listing is served from the cache before the PDS is listed again (default: 3600) |
| `--record-cache-prune-days` / `RECORD_CACHE_PRUNE_DAYS` | How long a signer's cached records and proofs are kept once nobody asks about them (default: 30) |
| `--signing-key-lifetime-days` / `SIGNING_KEY_LIFETIME_DAYS` | How long a signing key this server files lasts before it expires, counted from when it was first seen; a connection whose key expires is closed and the device signs in again. A key published in the account's records follows its record instead, and this server's own keys, other servers' own keys and a bot's did:key never expire (default: 90) |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | GitHub OAuth for credential verifier |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth secret |

### Federation

```bash
freeq-server \
  --iroh \
  --s2s-peers <peer-id> \
  --s2s-allowed-peers <peer-id> \
  --s2s-peer-api <peer-id>=https://peer.example.com
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--iroh` | off | Enable iroh QUIC transport |
| `--iroh-port` | random | UDP port for iroh |
| `--s2s-peers` | *(none)* | Peer endpoint IDs to connect to on startup |
| `--s2s-allowed-peers` | *(none — open)* | Allowlist for incoming peer connections |
| `--s2s-peer-api` | *(none — peer signatures stay uncheckable)* | Where each peer serves its users' signing keys: `<endpoint-id>=<https://base>` (the peer's REST API base URL). Deliberately operator configuration, never peer-announced |
| `--s2s-peer-trust` | *(none)* | Trust levels per peer: `id:full`, `id:relay`, `id:readonly` |

See [Federation](federation.md), [S2S Auth](S2S-AUTH-PLAN.md), and [Security Guide](SECURITY.md) for details.

#### Tasks this server referees

A task opened on this server names it as the task's referee, as `did:web:<--server-name>`, and other servers count this server's rulings on the task only under that name, checked against the keys it publishes at `/.well-known/did.json` and `/api/v1/signing-keys/`. Two limits follow from that:

- **Changing `--server-name`** stalls this server's open tasks on other servers: the name inside each task no longer matches the name its rulings are signed under.
- **Restoring the database from a backup** makes other servers drop this server's next rulings on tasks that were open at the time. Each ruling on a task is numbered, the restored database counts on from the backup, and a number another server already holds for something else is a conflict there.

### MOTD

```bash
freeq-server --motd "Welcome to my server"
# or
freeq-server --motd-file /path/to/motd.txt
```

## nginx Reverse Proxy

```nginx

    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name irc.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/irc.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/irc.example.com/privkey.pem;

    location /irc {

        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;

## Data Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `irc.db` | Message history, channels, user data (SQLite) |
| `irc-policy.db` | Policy rules and credentials (SQLite) |
| `msg-signing-key.secret` | Server message signing key (ed25519) |
| `verifier-signing-key.secret` | Credential verifier signing key |
| `db-encryption-key.secret` | Database encryption-at-rest key |
| `media-key.secret` | Seed for the private media store's encryption and link-signing keys |
| `iroh-key.secret` | iroh QUIC endpoint identity key |

All key files are generated automatically on first run.

> **⚠️ WARNING**: Never commit `*.secret` or `*.pem`/`*.key` files to version
> control. They are excluded by `.gitignore` but always verify before pushing.
> See [Security Hardening Guide](SECURITY.md) for key rotation procedures.

## Encryption at Rest

Message text is encrypted with AES-256-GCM before writing to SQLite. The key
is stored in `db-encryption-key.secret`. Messages are transparently decrypted
on read. Back up this key — losing it makes all stored messages unreadable.

## Backups

### Database

```bash
# Hot backup (SQLite VACUUM INTO)
sqlite3 /data/irc.db "VACUUM INTO '/backup/irc-$(date +%Y%m%d).db'"
sqlite3 /data/irc-policy.db "VACUUM INTO '/backup/irc-policy-$(date +%Y%m%d).db'"
```

Or simply copy the `.db` file while the server is stopped.

### Keys

```bash
# Back up all key files
cp /data/*.secret /backup/keys/
chmod 600 /backup/keys/*
```

> **Critical**: The `db-encryption-key.secret` file is required to read
> encrypted messages. If lost, message history is irrecoverable.

### Restore

1. Stop the server
2. Copy backup `.db` files to `--db-path` location
3. Copy backup `.secret` files to `--data-dir` location
4. Start the server

### Schema migrations

The database schema is versioned, and startup migrates it forward automatically — upgrading the server never needs a manual step. A binary refuses to open a database stamped with a *newer* schema than it knows, so **rolling back to an older binary requires downgrading the schema first**:

```bash
# Stop the server, then run the ladder down to the version the old binary expects:
freeq-server --db-path /data/irc.db --migrate-to 2
# Then start the older binary as usual.
```

The command prints the version it moved from and to, then exits without starting the server. Downgrades stop with an error at any migration that is irreversible by design (the database is left at the last version reached) — in that case, restore from backup instead. Take a backup before any downgrade regardless.

## Connection Limits

- **Per-IP**: 20 concurrent connections (TCP and WebSocket)
- **Rate limiting**: 10 commands/sec per client (token bucket, exempt during registration)
- **S2S**: 100 events/sec per peer

These are hardcoded. For additional rate limiting, configure your reverse proxy.

## Logging

```bash
# Default: human-readable
RUST_LOG=info freeq-server ...

# Structured JSON (for log aggregation)
RUST_LOG=info FREEQ_LOG_JSON=1 freeq-server ...

# Debug logging for specific modules
RUST_LOG=freeq_server::s2s=debug,info freeq-server ...
```
